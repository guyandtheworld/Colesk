# Colesk
Well, aren’t we all tired wasting our time without even being a teeny bit productive?
Everything that we use end up wasting our time. Doesn’t it?
Colesk is a Social Network for making the life of a college student more productive.
Colesk can be used as a portal for sharing of Homeworks 

Colesk makes life simpler. The interface of Colesk might look familiar as any Social Networking Site,
there’s the home page where all the current hot and new posts are present and it consists of your own customizable profile.
Colesk can not only be used by the students of the college but also can be used by the students
who just passed out from school or a student from somewhere else to get to know about the inside working of a college.
Which is something we can’t see in Other college websites.
This can be used to achieve better transperency for outsiders and can be used for the betterment of the college too.

Anyone, anywhere can view Colesk and its contents. Colesk is completely transparent and the
only thing you can decide your privacy is your own profile.
Colesk can be used as a medium to share opinions and to make a change.
To publically share issues and to bring about a change in any matter as a matter of fact.
One can use the Anonymous feature of Colesk to share their opinion without having to reveal themselves.

The moderators are also elected by the students in a kind of virtual election.
A student of a college can submit a change to their college and it will be implimented when the change gets enough support.
This can help to keep the control of the websites within the reach of the students
